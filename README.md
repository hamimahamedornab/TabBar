# Tab view screen

Create a Flutter app with three pages arranged in a tab view screen. Each page will
have a different coloured floating action button and a centred text widget displaying
the page number.
Requirements:

● Use MaterialApp and Scaffold widgets.

● Include an AppBar with a navigation drawer and a bottom navigation tab bar.

● The navigation drawer should allow users to navigate to each page.

● The bottom navigation tab bar should enable users to switch between the
pages.

● Each page should have a unique coloured floating action button.

● Centre a text widget on each page displaying the page number.

● Ensure navigation from the drawer and tab bar leads to the correct pages.

● Use TabBarView and TabBar widgets for tabbed navigation.

## Getting Started

I have provided a Flutter app that consists of three pages arranged in a tab view screen. The app follows the requirements that mentioned, including the usage of the MaterialApp and Scaffold widgets, an AppBar with a navigation drawer, and a bottom navigation tab bar. Each page has a unique colored floating action button and displays the page number in the center using a text widget. The app allows users to navigate between pages using both the drawer and the tab bar.
